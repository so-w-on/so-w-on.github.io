# Introduction
Unlike the usual "desktop" memory forensics , embedded memory forensics relies on processes (procfs), instead of RAM dumps.
However, a diagram on Volatility is still provided at the end of the article, mainly thanks to my love of the tool.

# Logic
1. First, we need a list of running processes
```bash
$ ps w
$ ps aux
```
It's important to identify unknown processes and processes whose spawn is suspicious.

2. Then, we identify deleted binaries. A lot of Malware tend to self-delete after performing their tasks, as an anti-analysis maneuver.
```bash
$ ls -l /proc/*/exe | grep deleted
```

3. By now, we already have a couple of suspicious-looking processes. We will check the memory maps of each of these processes:
```bash
$ cat /proc/<PID>/maps > PID_maps.txt
```
then extract readable memory (not executable?) memory segments from it:
```bash
$ grep r-x PID_maps.txt
```
------------
"Desktop" memory forensics go beyond the live-nature of the investigation. We can extract the system's memory then use volatility to search through it all (processes, files, commands, history, clipboard ...)
Here's a diagram of volatility and how to use it.
