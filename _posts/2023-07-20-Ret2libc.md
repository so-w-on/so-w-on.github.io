# Introduction
Ret2libc is an enhanced buffer overflow attack that can be executed even if NX is enabled (but ASLR is disabled), which means even when the stack isn't executable.

# Technique
The Ret2libc exploits functions already present in the c library (libc).
Particularly, it calls the `system` function and feeds it the string `/bin/sh` as an input.
: `system` can execute any command passed to it and together with `/bin/sh` calls a shell.

## Library navigation
To use the `system` function and the string `/bin/sh`, we need to have their addresses. These can be found using the following commands:

1. First, get the libraries used by the binary and their base addresses:
```bash
$ldd bin_file
	> Output:
	> <some libraries> <Their addresses>
	> libc.so.6 => /lib32/libc.so.6 (address of libc)
	> (*or /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 for 64-bit*)
```
2. Then get the offset from the libc base address of `system()`:
```bash
$readelf -s /lib32/libc.so.6 | grep system
	> Output:
	> number: offset_from_libc_base_@  <other......
```
3. Then get the offset from the libc base address of `/bin/sh`:
```bash
$strings -a -t x /lib32/libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh
	> Output:
	> offset_from_libc_base_@ /bin/sh
```

## The Payload used:
To execute a Ret2libc attack, we must supply a buffer that has the following structure:

TODO: buffer image: (padding until overflow)(system()@)(return @)("/bin/sh" @)

## For a 32-bit binary file:
