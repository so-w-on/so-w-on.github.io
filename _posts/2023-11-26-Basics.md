Although this article is named "Basics", it doesn't imply that the concepts here are somewhat easy or given.

This post aims to focus on small bit-sized topics that one should know about when starting Binary manipulation or exploitation.

First, Endianness. A very simple but crucial concept.

Big Endian:
....

Second, even if one doesn't know any assembly language, a person starting out in Binary manipulation should know about these registers and their use:

* A register is a memory space that .... much like a container.
* Depending on architectures, the register naming convention changes, but that only depends on the length of data they can contain.
