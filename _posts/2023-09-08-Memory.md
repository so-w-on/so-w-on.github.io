Memory Mangement is perhaps the most sensitive subject when it comes to binaries, or computing in general.
This article will give a brief description of how memory is used and managed when executing a program. Hopefully, I will be able to write a more in-depth article that overviews much more complex concepts like paging, segmentation, MMU, DMA, cache and mapping.

# Memory Structure

First of all, Memory is divided into 4 sections:

Code 
:   This section contains the program code. The code section is read-only and stores the program text. This section is also known as the text section.

Data 
:   This section contains the global and static variables. This section is also known as the initialized data section.

Heap
:    This section 

Stack
:

# Memory usage
Now that we know the structure of memory and the different components' use, we will dig more into how memory is used when a program is executed.

This particular point may get a bit messy, so I will explain it using an example.

## Program Example
Let's consider the following program code:

```bash
int foo(int a, int b){
    int c = a + b;
    return c;
}
int main(){
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    int z = foo(x, y);
    return 0;
}
```
## Execution Process of the example code
When this program is executed, the following happens:
TODO: schema and modify these instructions
1. The compiled code of the program is loaded into the `Code (Text)` section of the Memory.
2. To begin executing the `main()` function, some space is allocated to the variables x,y,z in the stack.
3. `main()` function is executed.
4. Since `main()` calls the function `foo()`, some space is allocated to the variables declared in `foo()` at stack-level.
5. `foo()` function is executed.
6. Once `foo()` returns, the space allocated to it is de-allocated.
>In C programming, this Memory space is not erased so if it's reallocated again, it will contain garbage value that need to be zeroed before any further use.
7. If the program contains any `static`, `global`, or manually-allocated variables, they are stored in the heap to be accessible throughout the program.
8. Once `main()` returns or a termination signal is received (for example if an error occurs or if the user stops execution), the memory allocated to the whole program is de-allocated.

## Steps of Execution from the Stack perspective
The Stack has a `Last-In-First-Out(LIFO)` structure. Below, we will have a look at how Memory changes during the previous steps, with a special focus on the stack since it's the section where most changes occur.
