# Introduction
Much like Memory Forensics, embedded disk persistence analysis differs from traditional desktop disk analysis, particularly the artifacts examined and the tools and techniques employed.
Standard tools like FTK don't usually work in the embedded context as the artifacts go from HDD/SDD to flash memory, EEPROM ... Thus we usually focus on configuration files, firmware, logs rather than the typical OS files.

# Logic
1. First, we need to verify the list of start/stop scripts and system configurations.
```bash
$ ls -l /etc/init.d
$ ls -l /etc/rc.d
```
It's important to identify unknown and unusual commands added to them.

2. Next, we check the periodic scripts
```bash
$ crontab -l
$ ls -l /etc/crontabs
```

3. Then, we run checks for recently modified files:
```bash
$ find /overlay -type f -mtime -2 -ls
```
and suspicious binaries:
```bash
$ find / -type f -perm -111 -size -500k 2>/dev/null
```

Out of all the sections in this malware project, Disk analysis is the one I'm least experienced in.
