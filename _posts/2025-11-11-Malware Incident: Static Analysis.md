# Introduction
Static analysis is a very useful phase to analyse any suspicious binaries that may have been discovered during "Mmemory forensics" or "Disk Persistence"
---> Goal?

# Logic
1. First, we need to collect some readily available information on our binary
```bash
$ file suspicious_binary
$ readelf -h supicious_binary
$ readelf -l suspicious_binary | grep interpreter
```
It's important to identify binary's type, compilation, architecture, headers.

2. Then, we can use our preffered reverse engineering tool (Personally, I use Ghidra and radare2, Ida is behind a price tag which is kind of a bummer)
We usually look for the:
- main() function
    - suspicious logic such as `socket`, `connect`, `send` ...
- The flow logic of the binary, 
    - The branching logic, which could lead to anti-analysis, anti-debug, killer routines
- Strings, which could lead us to hardcoded IP addresses, ports and hosts

A Malware dynamic Analysis should follow as the next step, but it's in the works.
Following is a cheatsheet for Ghidra
