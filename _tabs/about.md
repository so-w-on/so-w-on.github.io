This website is a means to document some of my cybersecurity discoveries that I take while studying new topics or doing wargame challenges like Hack The Box or Root-Me.
As for me, I'm a Graduate Engineering student majoring in Cybersecurity. I love taking notes of every single thing I learn; it helps me find the general skeleton of the topic.
